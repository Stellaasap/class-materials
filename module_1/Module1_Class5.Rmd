## Preliminaries

Again, first we load the packages that we will be using in this document.  It's good practices to load packages as the beginning so they are all in the same place.  If you decide later you need an additional package, add it to the top of the document!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # core group of tidyverse packages
library(kableExtra)  # to make nice tables
library(broom)   # for tidy model output
```

## Module 1: Smoking and the risk of disease

Questions of interest:

* **Question 1.1: ** How does the risk of disease compare for smokers and otherwise similar non-smokers?

<center>
![](Q1_dag.png){width=500px}
</center>

* **Queston 1.2: ** Does the contribution of smoking to the risk of disease vary by sex or socio-economic status (SES)?

<center>
![](Q2_dag.png){width=500px}
</center>

To address each question we want:

* A data display (graph or table)
* A statistical analysis (with interprepration)

We will answer these questions using data from the National Medical Expenditures Survey (NMES)

## Discussion of NMES logistic regression results for Question 1-1

In your breakout groups, take 20-25 minutes to discuss the following sets of logistic regression results and interpretations.  Looking at all 8 sets of results/interpretations, answer the following questions:

(1) In order to address the comparison of interest between smokers and non-smokers, which variable **must** be included in the model?

(2) In order to allow for comparison between smokers and **otherwise similar** non-smokers, what must be included in the model?  What must be included in the interpretation?

(3) To address our question of interest, should we interpret **all** the coefficients in the regression model?  Or just some of them?

(4) To address our question of interest, is it better to present/interpret the regression coefficients or the odds ratios?

(5) To address our question of interest, how can we include information about the significance of the relationship of interest in our interpretation?

(6) If you were to create a nice succinct table of results to communicate the relevant information from the R output to the reader, what pieces of information would you include? What could be excluded?  What aesthetic choices would you make when presenting the information in the table and in the text?

(7) For a variable like age, should we include it in our regression model in it's continuous form (see Results 2 and 8) or in a categorical form (see Results 1, 5, and 6)?  Why?

(8) Should the variables used to determine "otherwise similar" in the regression model match the variables used to determine "otherwise similar" in the data display (graph)?  Why or why not?

(9) We would like you to be **numerate** in your interpretations of your analysis results.  What do we mean by numerate and which interpretations below do a good job of being numerate?

(10) Are there any interpretations or results shown below that you think are technically incorrect?

### Results 1

**When similar on the basis of age and poor, ever smokers were ~ 2.03 times more likely to have a major smoking caused disease (MSCD) compared to never smokers –> When similar on the basis of eversmoke and poor status, individuals aged 30-60 were 5.25 times more likely than individuals aged less than 30 to develop a MSCD. –> When similar on the basis of eversmoke and poor status, individuals aged >60 were 27.94 times more likely than individuals aged less than 30 to develop a MSCD –> When similar on the basis of age and ever smoke status, poor individuals were ~ 2.80 times more likely to have a major smoking caused disease (MSCD) compared to not poor population.**

```{r echo = FALSE}
nmes_data <- read_csv("module_1/nmesUNPROC.csv")

###Recoding poor, chd5, lc5, eversmk, and adding age categories
nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(poor = factor(poor, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not Poor", "Poor")))

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(chd5 = factor(chd5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No CHD", "CHD")))

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(lc5 = factor(lc5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No LC", "LC")))

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(eversmk = factor(eversmk, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("Never Smoke", "Ever Smoke")))

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>% 
  mutate(age_cat = cut(age,
                      breaks = c(0,30,60,100),
                      labels = c("Age < 30", "Age 30-60", "Age > 60")))

###Consolidating CHD5 and LD5 into a new  "Disease" Variable
nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(lc5 == "LC" | chd5 == "CHD", 
                          levels=c(FALSE, TRUE), 
                          labels=c("No disease", "Disease")))
```

```{r}
### Wanted to find the realtionship between eversmk and disease status with poor and age categories as confounding variables
modelLR<- glm(disease ~ eversmk + age_cat + poor, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data)

###Tidying up table
modelLR %>%
  tidy(exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95) %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(conf.int = paste0("(", round(conf.low, digits = 3), ", ", round(conf.high,digits = 3), ")")) %>%
 mutate(Variable = c("Ever smoker", "Age 30-60", "Age > 60", "Poor")) %>%
  select(Term = Variable, OR = estimate, `p-value` = p.value, `95% CI` = conf.int) %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown") 
```

### Results 2

**Holding sex, age, poverty level, education, and BMI constant, the odds of smokers developing a major smoking-caused disease (MSCD) are 1.95 times higher than that compared to non-smokers. The odds ratio (OR) lies between the range 1.45 and 2.64 with 95% certainty and the OR of 2.05 is statistically significant at a level of p < 0.001.**

```

### Results 3

**Those who have ever smoked in their life have about 71% higher odds of developing a major smoking caused disease (MSCD) than those who have never smoked in their lives, holding sex and poverty status constant. This value is statistically significant, with a p-value of ~0.**

```{r echo = FALSE}
nmes_data <- read_csv("module_1/nmesUNPROC.csv")

# I am recoding the variables in order to make their meanings more clear for the data display (put this before the mutate)

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%

         female = factor(female, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("male", "female")),
         poor = factor(poor, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("no poverty", "poverty")),
         lc5 = factor(lc5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No Lung Cancer", "Lung Cancer")),
         chd5 = factor(chd5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("no heart disease", "heart disease"))
         )

# I am combining the lc5 diseases and chd5 diseases so that we can look at a variety of major smoking caused diseases rather than just lung cancer and other lung diseases when assessing the risk of disease

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(MSCD = factor(lc5 == "Lung Cancer" | chd5 == "heart disease", 
                          levels=c(FALSE, TRUE), 
                          labels=c("No MSCD", "MSCD")))

  mutate(Term = c("Has smoked", "Poverty Status", "Sex (female)")) %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```


### Results 4

1. **Smoking or not and packs per year(amount of smoking) have an significant influence in the lung cancer rate.**

2. **While looking into odds ratio, we conclude that smokers have 2.64 times higher risk of getting lung cancer. And a unit increase in packyears(increase 1 pack per year) will increase the risk of getting lung cancer by 0.029.**

3. **Marital status doesn't have a significant influence on the risk of getting lung cancer.**

### Results 5

**From the logistic regression, we can see that the odds of developing MSCD is 1.918 times that of ever smokers compared to never smokers. The odds of female participants developing MSCD is 0.751 times that of male participants. The odds of participants of the age 45-64 developing MSCD is 9.359 times that of participants under 45 years of age, while participants older than 65 has 33.825 times the odds of participants under 45. All groups had statistically significant difference when compared to the reference group.**

### Results 6

**The p-value was significant for the factors considered, age and poverty status. The odds of having coronary heart disease or lung cancer are greater for smokers compared with nonsmokers when holding age and poverty status constant.**

### Results 7

**Based on this information the odds of lc5 for females is 0.25 the odds of lc5 for males. The odds of lc5 is also higher for smokers than never smokers.**

## R notes based Assignment 1-2

We're including some notes here on aesthetics for improving your tables/displays as we start to work to a final project report.  You should also feel free to ask questions on Piazza if there is something you would like us to help you learn how to do!

### Recoding the data
```{r}
nmes_data <- read_csv("module_1/nmesUNPROC.csv")

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(eversmk = factor(eversmk, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("Never smoker", "Ever smoker")),
         lc5 = factor(lc5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No LC", "LC")),
         chd5 = factor(chd5, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No CHD", "CHD")),
         female = factor(female, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Male", "Female")),
         current = factor(current, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not current smoker", "Current smoker")),
         former = factor(former, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not former smoker", "Former smoker")),
         beltuse = factor(beltuse, levels= c("1", "2", "3"), labels = c("Rare", "Some", "Almost always")),
         educate = factor(educate, levels= c("1", "2", "3", "4"), labels = c("College grad", "Some college", "HS grad", "Other")),
         marital = factor(marital, levels= c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"), labels = c("Married", "Widowed", "Divorced", "Separated", "Never married")),
         poor = factor(poor, levels= c("0", "1"), labels = c("Not poor", "Poor"))
         )

nmes_data <- nmes_data %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(lc5 == "LC" | chd5 == "CHD", 
                          levels=c(FALSE,TRUE), 
                          labels=c("No MSCD", "MSCD")))
```

### Using knitr/kableExtra and the pander package for tables

We already talked about using the `kable()` function (from the `knitr` package) to make your tables look nicer:

Original:
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  count(disease)
```

Nicer:
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  count(disease) %>%
  kable(format = "pipe")
```

You can also add a caption to a table directly with the `kable()` function:
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  count(disease) %>%
  kable(format = "pipe",
        caption = "Table 1: Number of individuals with and without Major smoking-caused disease")
```

And you can change the number of decimals displayed in the table pretty easily as well.  Generally displaying only 3 significant figures in your tables is a good idea when you have values that include decimals.
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  count(eversmk, disease) %>%
  group_by(eversmk) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(disease == "MSCD") %>%
  kable(format = "pipe",
        caption = "Table 2: Proportions of individuals with and without a MSCD by smoking status",
        digits=3)
```

You can find lots of information about fine-tuning tables using `kable()` and the `kableExtra` package [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/tables.html).

There is also another package called `pander` which makes nice tables. You can install `pander` by running `install.packages("pander")`.  It works very similarly to `kable()` and you can find more information on how to modify settings heres [here](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/).

```{r}
library(pander)  # usually you would want to put this at the top of your document
nmes_data %>%
  count(eversmk, disease) %>%
  group_by(eversmk) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(disease == "MSCD") %>%
  pander(caption = "Table 2: Proportions of individuals with and without a MSCD by smoking status",
        digits=3)
```

To nicely display regression model output in a table, you can first store the results in a tidy format that can be manipulated like any other table/data in R. This is easy to do using the `tidy()` function from the `broom` package in R.  Remember, you'll have to use `install.packages("broom")` the first time you use it.

```{r}
library(broom)  # usually you would want to put this at the top of your document

my_model <- glm(disease ~ eversmk + age + female, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data)
tidy(my_model)
```

In this tidy version of the model output, you see the results are arranged as a data set with variables names `term`, `estimate`, `std.error`, `statistic`, and `p.value`.  You can put this into a nicer table form using `kable()` or `pander()`, but can also easily change column names and add/remove columns and rows:
```{r}
my_model <- glm(disease ~ eversmk + age + female, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=nmes_data)
my_model_results <- tidy(my_model)

my_model_results %>%
  kable(format = "pipe",
        digits = 3)

my_model_results %>%
  mutate(odds.ratio = exp(estimate)) %>%  # add a column with the odds ratios
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>% # remove the row with the intercept
  select(Variable = term, `Odds Ratio` = odds.ratio, `p-value` = p.value ) %>% # select only the columns we want, rearrange columns, and change names
  kable(format = "pipe",
        digits = 3)
```

Some of these things can be done automatically with options in the `tidy()` function.  You can see more options using `?tidy.glm`.
```{r}
my_model_results <- tidy(my_model, 
                         exponentiate = TRUE,
                         conf.int = TRUE)

my_model_results

my_model_results %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>% # remove the row with the intercept
  mutate(conf.int = paste0("(", round(conf.low, 2), ", ", round(conf.high, 2), ")")) %>% # combine the CI terms together into nice format 
  select(Variable = term, `Odds Ratio` = estimate, `p-value` = p.value, `95% Confidence Interval` = conf.int) %>% # select only the columns we want, rearrange columns, and change names
  kable(format = "pipe",
        digits = 3,
        align = c("l", "r", "r", "r"))
```

You can also change the variable names as well:
```{r}
my_model_results$term <- c("Intercept", "Ever smoker", "Age (years)", "Female")

my_model_results %>%
  filter(term != "Intercept") %>% # remove the row with the intercept
  mutate(conf.int = paste0("(", round(conf.low, 2), ", ", round(conf.high, 2), ")")) %>% # combine the CI terms together into nice format 
  select(Variable = term, `Odds Ratio` = estimate, `p-value` = p.value, `95% Confidence Interval` = conf.int) %>% # select only the columns we want, rearrange columns, and change names
  kable(format = "pipe",
        digits = 3,
        align = c("l", "r", "r", "r"))

```

### Making your report a little more readable

For your final assignment for this module, we will be asking you to write a report presenting your analysis with the answers to the questions posed. We want you to include all the code that you used for the analysis in the Rmd file, but not necessarily to print the output of the code to your html document. There are some very helpful tips for managing whether code and code output get printed to the screen to be found on the second page of this `rmarkdown` cheat sheet: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf

For example, if you want to create a table where you display the table, but not the code, you could put `echo=FALSE` in the top of the code chunk for that piece of code:
```{r , echo=FALSE}
my_model_results %>%
  filter(term != "Intercept") %>% # remove the row with the intercept
  mutate(conf.int = paste0("(", round(conf.low, 2), ", ", round(conf.high, 2), ")")) %>% # combine the CI terms together into nice format 
  select(Variable = term, `Odds Ratio` = estimate, `p-value` = p.value, `95% Confidence Interval` = conf.int) %>% # select only the columns we want, rearrange columns, and change names
  kable(format = "pipe",
        digits = 3,
        align = c("l", "r", "r", "r"),
        caption = "Table 1: Logistic regression results")

```

Similarly, if you have a code chunk that includes necessary code (that needs to run) but you don't want to see the code or the result of running that code, you can use `echo=FALSE` and `include=FALSE` in the top of the code chunk.
```{r , echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#Some important code that needs to run but we don't need to see or see the output!
```

### Selecting colors for figures

If you want to control the colors you are using in your graphs, [this](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-color.html) is a great detailed resource for seeing your options!

You can refer to a color in many different ways, but the easiest is by name.  You can see the complete list of 657 colors available in R by typing:
```{r eval=FALSE}
colors()
```

You can then assign the colors directly (if using only one color) or using the `scale_fill_manual()` function within your graph if you want different colors for different groups:
```{r}
plot_data <- nmes_data %>%
  count(eversmk, disease) %>%
  group_by(eversmk) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(disease == "MSCD")

ggplot(plot_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=eversmk, y=prop),
           stat="identity", fill = "deeppink")

ggplot(plot_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=eversmk, y=prop, fill = eversmk),
           stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("deeppink", "chartreuse1"))
```

Sometimes it's better to leave color choices to the professionals, who know which colors look good together.  If you load the `RColorBrewer` package with `install.packages("RColorBrewer")`, you can select from within a predetermined color palatte.  You can see these color palettes [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html).  You apply them in a similar way as your manual colors:

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all() # to see all the colors

ggplot(plot_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=eversmk, y=prop, fill = eversmk),
           stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

```

### Adding labels to figure and changing themes

The cool thing about `ggplot2` is that everything just builds on top of what you've already accomplished, so if you want to change the background, you can just change the theme with one more short line of code. Here, we'll use `theme_bw()` to remove the default gray background. We'll then add an additional line of code to change the color of the bars using `scale_fill_manual()`. Finally, we will relabel the axes and title using `labs()`.

```{r}
# Change the appearance of the plot
ggplot(plot_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=eversmk, y=prop, fill=eversmk), stat="identity") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(y="Risk of MSCD",
       x="",
       title="Risk of MSCD, comparing smokers to non-smokers")
```

One more important piece of controling the look of your plot in ggplot2 uses `theme()`. You can control the look of your graphing using the *many* arguments of theme. Here, we'll introduce how to change the axis text size; however, if you type `?theme` below, you'll see all of the things that can be changed on your plots using `theme()`. For a good demonstration of themes, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html

```{r}
# Here, we'll start playing with font size
ggplot(plot_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=eversmk, y=prop, fill=eversmk), stat="identity") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(y="Risk of MSCD",
       x="",
       title="Risk of MSCD, comparing smokers to non-smokers")+
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=12))
```

Finally, here's a link to good resource about adding lables, text, scales, and themes to your graphics: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html


### Moving or removing legends  in a figure

Whenever you use an aesthetic like `color` or `fill` or `shape` in the `ggplot()` function, R will automatically create a legend to the right of the graph:
```{r}
my_table <- nmes_data %>%
  count(disease, eversmk) %>%
  group_by(eversmk) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

ggplot(data = my_table) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = eversmk, y = prop, fill = disease), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```

You can change the name of this legend in the `labs()` function using the names of the aesthetic shown in the legend.  In this case, the legend shows the `fill` aesthetic, so we can rename it as follows:
```{r}
ggplot(data = my_table) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = eversmk, y = prop, fill = disease), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(fill = "MSCD status")
```

We can also move the legend to a different location using the `legend.position` option within the `theme()` function:
```{r}
ggplot(data = my_table) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = eversmk, y = prop, fill = disease), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(fill = "MSCD status") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Choices for the position can be `bottom`, `top`, `right`, `left`, or `none`.  The none option is especially useful when the legend doesn't add any useful information.  Consider the graph where we only show the risk of disease, not the risk of no disease:
```{r}
my_table <- nmes_data %>%
  count(disease, eversmk) %>%
  group_by(eversmk) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(disease == "MSCD")

ggplot(data = my_table) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = eversmk, y = prop, fill = disease), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(fill = "MSCD status")
```

The legend on the size is not useful since there's only one color anyway!  So we can remove it:
```{r}
ggplot(data = my_table) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = eversmk, y = prop, fill = disease), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(fill = "MSCD status") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Removing missing values

On Piazza one of you commented on how there are missing values with the BMI variable in this dataset.  We can see there are 124 missing values below: 
```{r}
nmes_data %>%
  count(is.na(bmi))
```

If you were planning to use the BMI variable in your analysis, you would need to do something to account for these missing values.  The topic of missing data could be an entire course of it's own; there are many ways to handle the missing values and usually just removing the observations where there are missing values is not appropriate because it can introduce bias into our results.

However much of the topic is beyond the scope of this course.  In this case, only about 3% of the observations have missing BMI data (`124/(124+3954)) = 0.0304`), so we may choose to just exclude those participants.  

If you wanted to remove all participants with missing values of `bmi`, you could use the `drop_na()` function to do this:
```{r}
nmes_data_sub <- nmes_data %>%
  drop_na(bmi)

dim(nmes_data)
dim(nmes_data_sub)
nmes_data_sub %>% count(is.na(bmi))
```

I wouldn't suggest doing this unless you are planning to use BMI in your analysis, because if you do you will be excluding some data that could be used to answer your question of interest!


## Starting Assignment 1.3

Do the following to address Question 1.1: How does the risk of disease compare for smokers and otherwise similar non-smokers?

1. (**Can work on this now!**) Improve your data display, if needed. Interpret your data display to answer the question. That is, what does this display say about Question 1.1? *Be sure to focus on answering the question being asked!*

2. (**Can work on this now!**) Update your multivariable logistic regression model, if needed.  Interpret your coefficients and associated significance tests to answer the question.  That is, what does this model say about Question 1.1?  *Be sure to focus on answering the question being asked!*

3. (**Wait for Wednesday!**) Complete a propensity score analysis to answer the question:

    * Estimate propensity scores for the treatment of smoking (`eversmk`); that is, use logistic regression to estimate the probability of smoking given possible confounders.
    * Use logistic regression with quintiles of your propensity scores to answer Question 1.1.
    * Interpret the results -- both the relevant coefficient(s) and associated significance tests. *Be sure to focus on answering the question being asked!*
    
    
4. (**Wait for Wednesday!**) Compare the results of your multivariable logistic regression with your propensity score analysis.  Are them similar? Different?  Which analysis method do you prefer and why?

5. Submission notes:
    * Submit your assignment in R Markdown through Github by Sunday (February 13, 2021) at midnight. You can find a link to create this assignment in Github on Blackboard.
    * Post a **screenshot of your multivariable logistic regression results and your propensity score results**, on Piazza in the  "Assignment 1-3 Results" thread.  **Include your interpretations of what these two models say about Question 1.1 and any thoughts you have on which of these two analysis methods is preferred for answering Question 1.1.** 
    * On Piazza, you are welcome to post anonymously to your classmates. You can also include comments about what your chose to do or questions you had as you were making the display and fitting your model.
